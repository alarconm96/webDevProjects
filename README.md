# webDevProjects
My personal web development projects. Some of these projects follow closely with the *Learning Web Design - A Beginner's Guide to HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Web Graphics* textbook by Jennifer Niederst Robbins. The rest are personal projects built for practice. **Unless stated otherwise, these web pages are not hosted publicly on any servers. Furthermore, I used these projects and the textbook for educational purposes ONLY.**
